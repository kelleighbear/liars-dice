    <h3 class="margin-xl-top text-center">The Rules</h3>
    <hr>
        <p>To begin each round, all players roll their dice simultaneously. Each player looks at their own dice after they roll, keeping them hidden from the other players.</p>
        <p>The first player then states a bid consisting of a face ("1's", "5's", etc.) and a quantity. The quantity represents the player's guess as to how many of each face have been rolled by all the players at the table, including themselves. For example,
            a player might bid "five 2's."</p>
        <p>The next player must either challenge the previous player's claim, or make a new claim that is at least one die higher (it can be an different number is the player chooses).</p>
        <p>If the player challenges the previous bid, all players reveal their dice. If the bid is matched or exceeded, the bidder wins. Otherwise the challenger wins.</p>
        <p>In this version of Liar's Dice, when a challenge is made, the game is over, and either the bidder or the challenger wins.</p>
